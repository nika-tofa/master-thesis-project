Predicting the spread of diseases remains an important aspect for epidemiological problems.
For these purposes, such areas as statistics, sociology and biology are used. Nowadays, there is a large number of approaches for modelling epidemiological problems using compartmental models.

The aim of this paper is to obtain solutions for a mathematical model of dynamics of an influenza epidemic using various methods and compare them to identify the optimal method for solving this problem. A number of the algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) for the deterministic modelling and Gillespie algorithm and a discrete approach for the agent-based modelling (ABM) were implemented with Matlab, a numerical computing environment. The data for implementing the algorithms is taken from the case of influenza epidemic in British Boarding School in 1978.
